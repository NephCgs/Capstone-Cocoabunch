# YOLOv10 Cocoa Bean Quality Classification

### Overview

This repository contains the necessary files for our capstone project on cocoa bean quality classification using YOLOv10. Our project aims to classify cocoa beans into different quality categories based on their visual characteristics. This work is part of our academic research and is not intended for commercialization.

### Repository Contents

We have uploaded key files needed to understand and reproduce our work, including:

 - Model weight files 

 - Custom YOLOv10 configuration files 

 - Dataset YAML file 

 - Streamlit app files for real-time classification 

### Dataset

Our dataset, which we collected and annotated ourselves, is available on Roboflow: https://universe.roboflow.com/capstonecacao/test_cacao/dataset/18

### Ultralytics Repository

Due to the large size of the full Ultralytics YOLO repository and potential licensing concerns, we have not uploaded it directly. Instead, we provide a compressed ZIP file containing our modified local version. If you need to use the full Ultralytics repository, please download it from their official GitHub: Ultralytics YOLO.

## Disclaimer

This project is strictly for academic and personal research purposes. It is not intended for commercial use, and we do not claim any ownership over the original YOLOv10 model or the Ultralytics repository. All rights to YOLOv10 belong to Ultralytics.
